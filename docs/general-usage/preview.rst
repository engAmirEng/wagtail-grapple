Headless Preview
================

Grapple also provides support for headless previews using the `Wagtail Headless Preview
<https://github.com/torchbox/wagtail-headless-preview>`_ package.
This means you can pass a unique 'preview token' to the GraphQL endpoint and preview a page as you update
it in the admin (in real-time!).

See the `Wagtail Headless Preview<https://github.com/torchbox/wagtail-headless-preview>`_ documentation for setup
instructions.
